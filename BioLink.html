		Hi, I'm Jasmine! I was born and raised in the City of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia, PA. During my time in high school, I joined the media and technology club where I fell in love with being behind the camera.<br>After earning my dipolma, I was enrolled in Morgan State University, where I currently major in Screenwriting Animation. I love being majoring in a field where I can have full creative control over my projects; and there are peers who have the same desire to be creatives and team players.<br>During my sophomore year, I purchased my first camera. I spent a lot of time just practicing the camera. I wanted to have full control, so when I am ready to shoot project, I know what I am doing.<br>From the support of my friends, I started getting clients. I used these experiences to build knowledge on entrepreneurship and customer service. Also, these experiences gave me motivation to learn other programs that would allow me to create digital art, without needing a camera.<br>Currently, I am a freelance digital artist. I am finishing up my last year at Morgan State, expected to graduate in Spring 2020. As I strive to the finish line, I plan on expanding my knowledge on photography, videography, graphic design, and entrepreneurship.<br>Jasmine Blackson - Eiram Visuals
